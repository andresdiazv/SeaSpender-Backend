The backend of the SeaSpender Finance/Budget App (Gamified) is built using Java and works in tandem with the frontend to ensure smooth functionality
and data management. It is responsible for handling user login and registration processes, securely storing encrypted passwords, and managing 
user data in a NoSQL database. The backend also takes care of processing and updating users' financial activities, such as tracking expenses, 
savings, and income, as well as managing the point and leveling systems. The APIs integrated into the backend allow for seamless data exchange 
between the frontend and backend, providing users with real-time updates on their progress, achievements, and financial goals. Additionally, 
the backend handles the friend system, enabling users to add, remove, and view their friends' profiles.
